# Agent Notes

## Project

App Template: a Flutter app (iOS, Android and web) and its NestJS backend,
made from the app template. It starts as sign-in, a blank home and an
assistant; the app is built on top of that.

1. **Flutter app** in `app/`.
2. **NestJS backend** in `server/`: REST API, Better Auth, Postgres.

### Language

Everything the user reads is in **Brazilian Portuguese**. On the app, every
such string lives in `app/packages/l10n/lib/arb/app_pt.arb` and is read
through `context.l10n`. A hardcoded user-facing string in Dart is a bug.
The server writes its own refusals in Portuguese, and the app shows them as
written. Code, comments, commits and this file stay in English.

## Stack

- **App:** Flutter + BLoC + go_router + l10n (ARB, `pt`).
- **Backend:** NestJS 11 + TypeScript + Better Auth + Drizzle ORM.
- **Database:** Postgres on Neon: a `dev` branch locally, `main` in
  production. `npm run db:local` runs an in-memory Postgres (PGlite) for
  working offline.
- **Assistant:** OpenRouter, behind `POST /api/assistant/chat`.
- **Analytics:** PostHog, off until a key is set.
- **Deploy:** two ARM64 images on GHCR (`apptemplate-backend`,
  `apptemplate-web`), pulled by a Raspberry Pi over SSH through a
  Cloudflare tunnel, served at `apptemplate.pietroteruya.dev`. See
  [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

```

## Auth

Better Auth runs inside the Nest server, mounted at `/api/auth/*` in
`main.ts` ahead of Nest's body parser (it reads the raw request itself).
Everything else under `/api` is Nest, protected by `SessionGuard`, which asks
Better Auth for the session behind the request and puts an `AuthUser` on it.

Google is the only way in, by two roads:

- **Web:** the OAuth redirect. `POST /api/auth/sign-in/social` answers with
  Google's URL, the browser leaves, comes back to `/`, and from then on
  sends the session cookie. The web app is served from the same origin as
  the API, so the cookie needs no CORS.
- **iOS/Android:** the native `google_sign_in` SDK produces an ID token
  (minted for the web client, via `serverClientId`), the app posts it to the
  same route, the server verifies it against `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` and answers
  with a session token. The app keeps it in the Keychain/Keystore
  (`TokenStore`) and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`.

`ALLOWED_EMAILS` gates sign-up: an address not on it never gets a user row.

Better Auth is ESM-only and the server compiles to CommonJS. That works
because Node ≥ 22.12 can `require()` ES modules; keep the images on Node 24.
Code under test must not import `better-auth` at runtime (Jest's CommonJS
sandbox cannot load it): `session.guard.ts` imports only its type.

## The assistant

`POST /api/assistant/chat { messages: [{ role, content }] }` answers
`{ reply }`; the last message is the person's, at most 40 of them. Nothing is
stored: the app keeps the conversation (`AssistantCubit`) and sends all of
it each turn. `GET /api/assistant/status` says whether a model is connected.
Without `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `OPENROUTER_MODEL` the chat answers 503 and
everything else works. The system prompt is `systemPrompt` in
`server/src/assistant/assistant.service.ts`; tools go in the second argument
of `OpenRouterClient.generate`.

## The design system

Screens draw only with `app_ui`: colours from `AppColors`, type from
`AppTypography`, gaps and radii from `AppSpacing`, icons from `AppIcons`. A
value a screen needs that is not a token becomes a new token, never a
literal. The look is restyled by the `/design-system` skill.

## Analytics

PostHog hears of each write that succeeded, by route, from
`LoggingInterceptor`; of every 5xx and crash; of the screens; and records
replays with every text and image masked. **Nothing a person wrote is ever
sent**, and **without `POSTHOG_KEY` nothing is sent at all**. A new write
route gets its row in `server/src/analytics/events.ts`. In the app only
`packages/analytics` calls the plugin; tests use `NoAnalytics`.

## The queue

Work reaches the repo as GitHub issues labelled `create`, `research` or
`improve` (the issue templates add them), worked by `.tool/queue` on the
Mac: each phase a headless Claude in its own worktree and branch, stopping
at each gate with a comment and a push to the phone; "approve" alone goes
on, anything else is feedback. The skills it runs are `/create`,
`/research` and `/improve`. See [.tool/README.md](./.tool/README.md).

## Commands

```bash
.tool/check             # CI's checks on what changed (--all: everything)

# Server
cd server
npm run db:local        # optional: in-memory Postgres on :5433
npm run start:local     # watches; needs server/.env.local (see .env.example)
npm test
npm run db:generate     # after editing src/db/schema.ts; commit drizzle/

# App
cd app
flutter run --flavor dev --dart-define-from-file env/dev.json
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 5173 --dart-define-from-file env/dev.json
flutter test
(cd packages/l10n && flutter gen-l10n)   # after editing app_pt.arb; commit gen/
dart run flutter_launcher_icons          # after changing brand/
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
```

Migrations run on server boot (`migrateDatabase` in `main.ts`), so there is
no separate migrate step in deployment.
