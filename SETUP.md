# Setup

The setup CLI (in the app template) does all of this for a new app and
prints what is left. This is what it does, for doing any of it again by
hand.

## 1. Neon

A Neon project (region **AWS São Paulo, `sa-east-1`**, next to the Pi) with
two branches: `main` for production, `dev` for local work. Each branch's
connection string ends in `?sslmode=require`. The schema is created by the
server itself: migrations in `server/drizzle/` run on every boot.

## 2. Google OAuth

One Google Cloud project for the app, so the consent screen names it. Under
**APIs & Services → Credentials**:

1. **Web client** (type *Web application*):

   | | |
   |---|---|
   | JavaScript origins | `https://<your-domain>`, `http://localhost:5173`, `http://localhost:3000` |
   | Redirect URIs | `https://<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/google`, `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` |

   Its secret goes to the server only.
2. **iOS client** for `com.<your-prefix>.<app>`, and another for
   `com.<your-prefix>.<app>.dev`.
3. **Android client** for each package (the same two), with your keystore's
   SHA-1 (`cd app/android && ./gradlew signingReport`).

Then:

- `server/.env*` and the Pi's `.env`: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` (the web client
  first, then each iOS client) and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- `app/env/<flavor>.json`: `GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID` and that flavor's
  `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID`.
- `app/ios/Flutter/GoogleSignIn.xcconfig`: each iOS client ID reversed
  (`com.googleusercontent.apps.<id>`), the URL scheme Google returns to.

## 3. Local development

```bash
# Server
cd server
cp .env.example .env.local      # fill DATABASE_URL (Neon dev), secrets, Google
npm install
npm run start:local             # http://localhost:3000/api

# App (another terminal)
cd app
cp env/dev.example.json env/dev.json
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 5173 --dart-define-from-file env/dev.json
flutter run --flavor dev --dart-define-from-file env/dev.json   # phone/simulator
```

On the web the dev server must run on **5173**: it is the origin the server
trusts (`TRUSTED_ORIGINS`) and Google redirects back to. On a physical
phone, `API_BASE_URL` must be your machine's LAN address
(`http://192.168.x.x:3000/api`), not `localhost`.

## 4. The Raspberry Pi

The Pi runs two containers from GHCR, in `/opt/<app>`:

- `<app>-backend`: the API, published on the Pi's loopback only
  (`curl localhost:$BACKEND_PORT/api/health` there);
- `<app>-web`: nginx serving the Flutter web build and proxying `/api`
  to the backend, on `WEB_PORT`, which the Cloudflare tunnel routes
  `<your-domain>` to.

`/opt/<app>/.env` is the server's production env (see
`server/.env.example`, with `BETTER_AUTH_URL=https://<your-domain>`)
plus `WEB_PORT` and `BACKEND_PORT`. `scripts/pi_setup.sh` installs it, checks
the ports and adds the tunnel's hostname (`scripts/cloudflare_add_domain.sh`):

```bash
scp scripts/pi_setup.sh scripts/cloudflare_add_domain.sh server.env focus:
ssh -t focus ./pi_setup.sh <app> <web port> <backend port> <your-domain> server.env
```

To roll back, set `APP_TAG=<commit sha>` (one of the five kept) in the
`.env` and run `docker compose up -d`.

## 5. DNS and the Cloudflare Tunnel

The public domain can be either an apex (`my-own.app`) or a subdomain
(`app.my-own.app`).

**Apex (`my-own.app`)**

- The Cloudflare tunnel creates a CNAME record at the apex. Cloudflare
  supports CNAME flattening for apex domains, so this works on a
  proxied (orange-cloud) record.
- Google OAuth JavaScript origin and redirect URI must be exactly
  `https://my-own.app` and `https://my-own.app/api/auth/callback/google`.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and the app's `API_BASE_URL` must also use
  `https://my-own.app`.

**Subdomain (`app.my-own.app`)**

- Easier if you already use the apex for something else. The tunnel
  creates a proxied CNAME from `app.my-own.app` to
  `<tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com`.
- Google OAuth, `BETTER_AUTH_URL` and `API_BASE_URL` all use
  `https://app.my-own.app`.

**Setting it up**

1. Add the domain to your Cloudflare account (Nameservers or CNAME setup).
2. Create a Cloudflare Tunnel: **Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels** → Create
   tunnel. Copy the tunnel token.
3. Install `cloudflared` on the Pi and run it with the token:
   ```bash
   cloudflared service install <token>
   ```
   Or manage the tunnel in the dashboard and let `cloudflare_add_domain.sh`
   edit it through the API (it needs `CF_API_TOKEN` with Zone > DNS > Edit
   and Account > Cloudflare Tunnel > Edit).
4. Run `scripts/cloudflare_add_domain.sh <your-domain> <web-port>` on the
   Pi. It adds the ingress rule and the DNS record.

   **A domain in a zone of its own** (say the Pi already serves
   `*.pietroteruya.dev` and the new app is `my-own.app`): the `cert.pem`
   from `cloudflared tunnel login` belongs to one zone, and
   `cloudflared tunnel route dns` quietly creates
   `my-own.app.pietroteruya.dev` instead. Run the script with
   `CF_API_TOKEN` (Zone > DNS > Edit on the new zone) and it creates the
   record in the right zone through the API. Without the token it stops
   and says what to add in the dashboard: a proxied `CNAME @ →
   <tunnel-id>.cfargotunnel.com` in the new zone.
5. Wait for DNS, then `curl -I https://<your-domain>` should hit the Pi. If
   your machine looked the name up before the record existed, it may keep
   the "not found" answer for up to 30 minutes (the zone's negative TTL):
   check with `dig +short <your-domain> @1.1.1.1`, and on macOS clear it
   with `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`.

## 6. GitHub

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on every push to `main`: tests, and once
the variable `DEPLOY` is `true`, builds both images for ARM64, pushes them to
`ghcr.io/<owner>/`, SSHes to the Pi through the tunnel and runs
`docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

`scripts/gh_setup.sh` sets the deploy's secrets and variables from
`~/.config/pi-deploy/deploy.env` and the Pi's own deploy key:

| | |
|---|---|
| Secrets | `PI_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `TUNNEL_SERVICE_TOKEN_ID`, `TUNNEL_SERVICE_TOKEN_SECRET` |
| Variables | `PI_USER`, `CLOUDFLARE_SSH_HOSTNAME`, `POSTHOG_KEY` (optional), `DEPLOY` |

Keep the images **private** (your profile → Packages → each image →
Package settings).

## 7. PostHog

Optional, and off until its key is set. The project key (`phc_…`) goes in
the server's `POSTHOG_KEY`, the repository variable `POSTHOG_KEY` (the web
build) and `app/env/production.json` (the phones). In the project's
settings: session replay and canvas capture on, heatmaps and autocapture
off, error tracking on.

## Mobile builds

```bash
cd app
flutter build ipa --flavor production --dart-define-from-file env/production.json
flutter build appbundle --flavor production --dart-define-from-file env/production.json
```
